Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon the lining.  These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head. "Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!" she said, standing on her left foot. "What did you say?" asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was doing.

"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!"  Dorothy went on, standing this time on her right foot. "Hello!" replied the Tin Woodman calmly. "Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet. This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them. The King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, "What is your command?" "We wish to go to the Emerald City," said the child, "and we have lost our way."

"We will carry you," replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her. Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little Monkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to bite him.

The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before; but they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them. Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys, one of them the King himself.  They had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her. "Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?" she asked. "That is a long story," answered the King, with a Winged laugh; "but as we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you about it, if you wish."

"I shall be glad to hear it," she replied. "Once," began the leader, "we were a free people, living happily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master.  Perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest.  But we were careless and happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day.

This was many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land. "There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who was also a powerful sorceress.  All her magic was used to help the people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good.  Her name was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby.  Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise.

At last, however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years.  Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish.  When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called, was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding. "My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which lived in the forest near Gayelette's palace, and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner.

One day, just before the wedding, my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside the river.  He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do.  At his word the band flew down.

'What size do you want to be?' it asked. 'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one  doesn't like changing so often, you know.' 'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar. Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life  before, and she felt that she was losing her temper. 'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar. 'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'  said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'

'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing  itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). 'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And  she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily  offended!' 'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the  hookah into its mouth and began smoking again. This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In  a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth  and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the  mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,  'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you  grow shorter.'

'One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself. 'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it  aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight. Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying  to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly  round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she  stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit  of the edge with each hand. 'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of  the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent  blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt  that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she  set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed  so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her  mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the  lefthand bit. 'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which  changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders  were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was  an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a  sea of green leaves that lay far below her. 'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice.

'And where HAVE my  shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,  except a little shaking among the distant green leaves. As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she  tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her  neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had  just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going  to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops  of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made  her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and  was beating her violently with its wings. 'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.

'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!' 'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,  and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems  to suit them!' 'I haven't the least idea what you're.
